          <h3>The Wedding</h3>
          <h4>Date: 9th August 2025</h4>
          <h4>
            Venue: Via Roccolo di Roselle 10, Negrar (VR), 37024, Italy
          </h4>
          <p>
            Add map coordinates
          </p>
          <h4>
            Dress Code
          </h4>
          <p>
            Whatever you want! But we would suggest no heels (as we will be on grass) and very breezy clothes (it's going to be hot!). Swimming costumes allowed ;)
          </p>
          <h4>
            How to get there on the day?
          </h4>
          <p>
            We will be organising transport from your accommodation to the venue. The only exception if you are planning not to drink and have your own vehicle, then you can park directly at the venue
          </p>
          <h4>
            The agenda (for now)
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>17:00 - Reception with snacks and drinks (aperitivo style). Time to mingle :)</li>
            <li>18:15 - Move to ceremony space</li>
            <li>18:30 - Ceremony with YeşFil, might get cheesy </li>
            <li>19:00 - Finish aperitivos while taking pictures and hugging "newly wed"</li>
            <li>19:30 - Dinner time! Sit at tables and eat (a lot), especially if you are planning to drink Amarone or Rakı</li>
            <li>21:00 - Enjoy the sunset, mingle with other guests while trying not to get drunk with Amari</li>
            <li>21:30 - Move to indoor space to  dance, make noise and have a blast</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
            How to get home?
          </h4>
          <p>
            We will be organising transport at regular intervals that will take you to your accommodation (probably every 45 min from 22:00)

          <h3>Getting to Verona</h3>
          <p>Here is the list of the Airports in order of distance</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Verona, VRN Valerio Catullo (30 mimutes, usually very hard to find a flight from most countries)</li>
            <li>Bergamo, BGY Orio al Serio (1h 30min, usually the cheapest and most serviced)</li>
            <li>Bologna, ... (1h 45min)</li>
            <li>Treviso, ... (1h 45min)</li>
            <li>Milano, LIN Linate (2h)</li>
            <li>Milano, MXP Malpensa (2h 15min to 3h 15 min, there can be a lot of traffic)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Transport</h3>
          <p>We suggest to rent a car directly from the airport as public transport is very lacking outside the city center. A good website to compare deals is rentalcars.com and they have their own full coverage insurance with is normally less than the one offered by the companies. if you need a hand planning the logistics, let us know and we can help out :)</p>
          <h3>Accommodation</h3>
          <p>We suggest to stay close to Negrar, but if you are happy to drive ~30 minutes, then Verona is doable. There is a lot of B&Bs and rooms around (most of them on Airbnb or Booking), just double check their drive distance from the venue on Maps as there are a lot of hills, so it might be further than it looks. If you do not want to spend much, we have a deal with Hotel Konaqui in San Vito, 80 euro/night for a double room and 108 euro/night for a triple room, and Hotel Diamante in Negrar, 100 euro/night for a double room.</p>
